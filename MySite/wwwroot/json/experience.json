    "description": "<p>While working at Technologica Ltd. I was part of the .NET department of the company and worked as Software Engineer Intern. I had the opportunity to be part of the team developing the military data exchange system of the Bulgarian National Codification Bureau for NATO. My responsibility in the team was to create the core of the system, which was validating, processing, saving the messages and responding to them. The project is written using .NET (C# for the business logic, ASP.NET Core as the web framework, Oracle for the database, Entity Framework for the object-relational mapping framework). My main accomplishments were in the business logic and working with the database.</p><p>I was also part of the team redesigning and rewriting RegIX (Registry Information eXchange system) &mdash; a web information system for data exchange between government institution in Bulgaria. My responsibilities were in the Back-end &mdash; controllers, services and repositories for the REST services used for exchanging data.</p><p>At Technologica I met many friendly people, which are still very close friends to me, and found a friendly working environment, encouraging everyone to show the best version of themselves.</p>",

    "description": "<p>I was working in Gamesoft Ltd. as a software engineer in order to broaden my horizons in the sphere of Computer Science. I gained a great deal of knowledge about the principles of Object-oriented programming and enhanced my skills as high-quality programming code was an essential part of my job. Moreover, I created unit tests for each fragment of code I designed as it was absolutely essential for minimizing the number of mistakes. It was also needed because these unit tests could prove that the functionalities have not altered, as the code could be redesigned in the future and used by other software engineers. Unit tests also provide additional insight, if a bug occurs, which saves a great deal of time while solving that bug.</p><p>While working there my main assignment was to write classes by previously established requirements and functionalities. For that I used primarily C#, Java or C++, whichever was needed for the specific project. This thought me how to be more flexible and adapt to what is needed by me. I also had to alter and improve websites when needed using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.</p><p>Working with databases was also part of my responsibilities while I was working in Gamesoft Ltd. I used to write queries for procedures, views, transactions and functions for the databases of our clients. When using databases in applications I used Entity Frameworks in .NET. Furthermore, .NET turned out to be the programming technology I prefer to use for creating software.</p>",
