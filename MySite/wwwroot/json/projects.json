    "description": "<p>BulCod was about redesigning the NATO system to work with XML instead of an old format following the encoding of 80-column punch cards initially used in the 1960s. My responsibility was to design and develop the core which was performing the destination validation of the messages, as they should be consistent with the NATO Database and follow some specific rules (defined in ACodP-1 NATO Manual on Codification) for the information they encode. After that the messages are saved into the database, their actions performed in the system and finally XML response message is generated, which is transferred back to the NATO Codification Bureau, that sent the initial message.</p>",
